\value{
Vector of indices representing admissible dose combinations
}
\description{
Determine if dose combinations are admissible based on proximity to current dose
}
\details{
A reference class that implements a neighbour-based rule for determining which dose combinations
are admissible in a dose-finding study. This rule restricts dose escalation or de-escalation
to neighbouring dose combinations.

The NeighbourAdmissible class implements the isAdmissible method by identifying dose combinations
that are adjacent to the current dose level. This ensures that dose changes occur gradually,
enhancing patient safety by preventing large jumps in dosing.
