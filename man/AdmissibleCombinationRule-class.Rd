\details{
An abstract reference class that defines the interface for determining which
dose combinations are admissible in a dose-finding study. This class serves as
a base class for implementing specific admissibility rules.

The AdmissibleCombinationRule class provides a framework for implementing rule-based
approaches to determine which dose combinations are considered safe and ethical to administer
to patients in a dose-finding study. Subclasses of this class implement specific rules
and criteria based on different methodological approaches.
