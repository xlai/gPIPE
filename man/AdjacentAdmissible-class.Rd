\description{
Determine if dose combinations are admissible based on adjacency to the acceptance boundary
}
\details{
A reference class that implements an admissibility rule based on adjacency to the
current set of acceptable and unacceptable doses. This rule identifies doses that
are immediately adjacent to the acceptance boundary.

The AdjacentAdmissible class implements the isAdmissible method by identifying dose
combinations that are adjacent to the current boundary between acceptable and unacceptable
doses. This approach helps in efficiently exploring the dose-toxicity relationship by
focusing on the region where the dose-toxicity relationship is changing.
