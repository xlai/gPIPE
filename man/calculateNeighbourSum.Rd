\title{Calculate Sum of Neighboring Elements in a Matrix}
\usage{
calculateNeighbourSum(A, matrixDims)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A numeric vector representing a flattened matrix}

\item{matrixDims}{A numeric vector of length 2 containing the dimensions of the matrix:
c(number_of_columns, number_of_rows)}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same dimensions as the input matrix, where each element
contains the sum of its neighboring elements (up, down, left, and right)
}
\description{
This function calculates the sum of adjacent elements (up, down, left, and right)
for each element in a matrix. The function is particularly useful in dose-finding studies
for identifying boundary regions between acceptable and unacceptable dose combinations.
}
\details{
The function reshapes the input vector into a matrix of dimensions specified by \code{matrixDims},
pads the matrix with a border (1s on top, left, and part of right/bottom, 0s on the
bottom-right corner), and calculates the sum of the four adjacent elements for each position.

This is particularly useful for identifying transition boundaries in dose-toxicity matrices
where a sum of 2 often indicates potential Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) positions.

\examples{
# Create a sample binary matrix
mat <- c(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
dims <- c(3, 3)  # 3 columns, 3 rows

# Calculate neighbor sums
neighbor_sums <- calculateNeighbourSum(mat, dims)
