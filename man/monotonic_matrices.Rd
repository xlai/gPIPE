\title{Generate All Monotonic Binary Matrices}
\usage{
monotonic_matrices(I, J, direction = c("increasing", "decreasing"))
}
\arguments{
\item{I}{Integer specifying the number of rows}

\item{J}{Integer specifying the number of columns}

\item{direction}{Character string specifying the direction of monotonicity:
\itemize{
\item "increasing": Values increase or stay the same as row/column indices increase
\item "decreasing": Values decrease or stay the same as row/column indices increase
}}
}
\value{
A list of all possible monotonic binary matrices of dimension IÃ—J
}
\description{
This function generates all possible binary (0/1) matrices of a given dimension
that satisfy monotonicity constraints in both row and column directions.
These matrices can be used to represent valid dose configurations in dose-finding studies
where toxicity is assumed to be monotonic with respect to dose levels.
}
\details{
For dose-finding studies, these matrices can represent valid dose-toxicity relationships:
\itemize{
\item 1 represents acceptable toxicity
\item 0 represents unacceptable toxicity
}

In the "increasing" direction, a dose is acceptable only if all lower doses are also acceptable.
In the "decreasing" direction, a dose is unacceptable only if all higher doses are also unacceptable.

The function uses a recursive approach to build all possible matrices that satisfy
the monotonicity constraints.

# Generate all 2x2 matrices with increasing monotonicity

# Generate all 2x2 matrices with decreasing monotonicity
