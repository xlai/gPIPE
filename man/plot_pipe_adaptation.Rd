\item{max_cohorts}{Maximum number of cohorts to display, or NULL to use all available cohorts}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in the grid}

\item{title_text}{Title text for the plot}

\item{save_path}{File path to save the plot, or NULL to not save}

\value{
A ggplot object with the combined plots
}
\description{
Creates a grid of plots showing how the PIPE algorithm adapts its dose recommendations
as new patient outcomes are observed across multiple cohorts in a single simulation.
Each plot displays the cumulative DLT proportions and the current boundary
between estimated safe and unsafe doses after each cohort.
