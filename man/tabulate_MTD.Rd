\title{Tabulate MTD selection frequency}
\usage{
tabulate_MTD(simulation_results, nrow, ncol, type = "RP2D")
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation_results}{A list of simulation result objects, each containing
either an 'RP2D' element (single value) or an 'MTD' element (possibly multiple values)}

\item{nrow}{Integer specifying the number of rows in the dose matrix (typically the number of levels for drug A)}

\item{ncol}{Integer specifying the number of columns in the dose matrix (typically the number of levels for drug B)}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of analysis to perform:
\itemize{
\item "RP2D": Analyze the Recommended Phase 2 Dose selections (default)
\item "MTD": Analyze the Maximum Tolerated Dose selections (may include multiple values per simulation)
}}
}
\value{
A matrix of selection percentages, with dimensions nrow Ã— ncol,
where each cell represents the percentage of simulations that identified
the corresponding dose combination as the MTD or RP2D
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage of simulations where each dose combination is identified
as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming simulation_results is a list of simulation outputs
# For a 3x4 dose combination matrix (drug A has 3 levels, drug B has 4 levels)
selection_matrix <- tabulate_MTD(simulation_results, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)

# For MTD analysis instead of RP2D
mtd_matrix <- tabulate_MTD(simulation_results, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, type = "MTD")
}
