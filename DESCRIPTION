Description: Implements a generalized Product of Independent Beta Probabilities Escalation (PIPE) 
    design incorporating epsilon-tapering for dual-agent dose-finding studies. Building on Cheung et al.'s (2022) asymmetric posterior gain and 
    epsilon-tapering framework, gPIPE improves dose-space exploration while effectively 
    controlling false discovery rates. The implementation features flexible admissibility rules, 
    multiple dose selection strategies, and robust simulation tools for design calibration, 
    evaluation, and comparison with existing dose-finding methodologies.
